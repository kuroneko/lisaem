Lisa Emulator Source Build README                    http://lisaem.sunder.net/
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Compiling for Linux:

You will need netpbm as well as wxWdigets 2.8.4 installed.

You will want to install/compile wxWidgets without the
shared library option.      

After installing/compiling wxWidgets, ensure that wx-config
is in your path, cd to the source code directly and run

	./build.sh clean build
	./build.sh install  


This will install the lisaem and lisafsh-tool binaries to
/usr/local/bin, and will install sound files to 
/usr/local/share/LisaEm/

If your system has the upx command available, it will
also compress the resulting binary with upx in order to save
space.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compiling for Raspbian:

NOTE: the wx2.8 packages do not work with LisaEm!

Build wxWidgets (I used 2.9.5), you can download a tarball from
http://lisaem.sunder.net/downloads/wxWidgets-2.9.5-gtk-raspbian-2015.09.01.tar.bz2                                                                                                                                                                                           

(If your raspbian matches Raspbian GNU/Linux 7
Linux raspberrypi 3.18.7-v7+ #755 SMP PREEMPT Thu Feb 12 17:20:48 GMT 2015 armv7l GNU/Linux )

or:

Build wxWidgets and LisaEm yourself like so (assuming your user is pi)

sudo -s
apt-get install libgtk-3-dev netpbm upx  #upx is optional
cd ~
VER=2.9.5
TYPE=gtk
cd wxWidgets-${VER}
mkdir build-${TYPE}
cd    build-${TYPE}
../configure --enable-unicode --enable-debug --disable-shared --without-expat --without-regexp --disable-richtext          \
             --with-libtiff=builtin --with-libpng=builtin --with-libjpeg=builtin --with-libxpm=builtin --with-zlib=builtin \
             --prefix=/usr/local/wx${VER}-${TYPE} && make && make install
cd ~pi
export PATH=/usr/local/wx2.9.5-gtk/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/wx2.9.5-gtk/lib:/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib
cd lisaem-1.2.6.1
./build.sh clean --without-static --without-rawbitmap  build install
cd ~
chown -R pi ~pi
ln -s /usr/local/share/LisaEm /usr/local/share/lisaem

There's a bug where it warns on startup about wxScroll, you can ignore it.

Once LisaEm is built with --with-static, wxWidgets should no longer be needed.

TODO: convert wxWidgets and LisaEm to proper Rpi .debs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiling for Mac OS X 10.3 and higher:

You will need to download the source code for wxWidgets 2.8.0
from www.wxwidgets.org.  After extracting it, you'll need
to modify it as follows:


IMPORTANT!

In your wxMac-2.8.0 dir, edit the file

include/wx/mac/carbon/chkconf.h

change the line with '#define wxMAC_USE_CORE_GRAPHICS 1' 
to                   '#define wxMAC_USE_CORE_GRAPHICS 0'


(Many thanks to Brian Foley for finding this!)

If you do not do this, the display will look very ugly.


You will want to install/compile wxWidgets without the
shared library option.      


	./build.sh clean build

The application will be inside of the source code
directory under ./lisa as LisaEm.app



------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiling for win32:

You will need the following:

A fairly full install of the Cygwin environment in order to be
able to run the build.sh script.   Be sure to also install
the netpbm package under Cygwin.  If you would like the build
script to compress the resulting lisaem.EXE, you should also
install the Cygwin UPX package as well.


Download and install the wxDev C++ 6.10 Environment.  Please
download it http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/ and install it in 
c:\\wxDev-Cpp

You should then be able to just run build.sh from under the
Cygwin shell after changing into the source code directory.


	./build.sh clean build
	./build.sh install  

The application will be copied to C:\Program Files\LisaEm\

We do not yet have an installer program for LisaEm, but future
versions will support that.


If your system has the upx command available, it will
also compress the resulting binary with upx in order to save
space.
